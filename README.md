### This project was created using the fllowing technologies:
* HTML,
* CSS,
* Javascript

### This project uses Parcel js to build and bundle all the HTML, CSS and Javascript code.
#### Descriptions:
- Parcel minifies the CSS code by default using cssnano, but I needed to set up the autoprefixer plugin manualy using the postcss config file for cross-browser support, and added the browserslistrc config file for extra support setups.
- Parcel also compiles and transpile the javascript code by default for the most basic usecases.

1- Run npm install,
2- Run npm start,
3- Go to the port provided by parcel in the terminal log and use the app.
