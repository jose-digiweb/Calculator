# Calculator project

### This project was created using the fllowing technologies:
* HTML,
* CSS,
* Javascript

### This project uses Parcel js to build and bundle all the HTML, CSS and Javascript code.
#### Descriptions:
- Parcel minifies the CSS code by default using **cssnano**, but I needed to set up the **autoprefixer** plugin manualy using the **postcss** config file for cross-browser support, and added the **browserslistrc** config file for extra support setups.
- Parcel also compiles and transpile the javascript code by default for the most basic usecases.

1- Run npm install,
2- Run npm start,
