# Calculator project

### This project was created using the fllowing technologies:
* HTML,
* CSS,
* Javascript

### This project uses Parcel js to build and bundle all the HTML, CSS and Javascript code.
#### Descriptions:
- Parcel minifies the CSS code by default using **cssnano**, i only needed to set up the **autoprefixer** plugin manualy using the **postcss** config file for cross-browser support, and added the **browserslistrc** config file for extra support setups.
- Parcel also compiles and transpile the javascript code by default for the most basic usecases.
## How to use the App
#### Everything that is needed for this app to work is listed inside the package.json file, just follow the steps bellow:
1. Open the terminal on the project **root directory**,
2. Run the script: **npm install**,
3. Run the script: **npm start**,
4. The App will be ready to use on **localhost** using the **port** provided by Parcel (usually "1234") that will be logged into the terminal after the build process finishes.
### Code Dacumentation
#### First of all, I did my best to write the mostly self documented code as it should be.
#### Besides that, I used inline comments where needed to provide a more clear understanding about the pupose of every methods, the inputs and what output it should provide.
